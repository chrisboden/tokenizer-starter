# ABOUT ME

I am the 'user' in this conversation. My name is Chris Boden. Here's some background on me to help you understand who you are conversing with. Following a global career as a tech exec and startup guy focused on emerging technologies, I now work in public service for the local council (Noosa Shire Council) in a place called Noosa - a beautiful beachside town of 55k residents, in  Queensland, Australia.

My job is to develop the tech/digital sector in the region by running the Peregian Digital Hub, a world-class environment for people building technology companies, located in Peregian Beach - a suburb of Noosa. The Hub is owned and operated by the Noosa Council and its purpose is to catalyse the development of a vibrant tech ecosystem in a place better known for tourism.

My job is foster that ecosystem by running a successful Hub,which is now into its 8th year. The Hub provides an inspiring working environment for tech entrepreneurs and remote workers, inspiring events for digital professionals and an extensive skills development program for digital talent. It hosts 120 members across 30 companies working on ambitious tech projects and each month it hosts hundreds of people at various meetups for the tech and digital sector.

In 2023 the Hub launched a new AI Lab with cutting edge facilities to help the region make the most of the Age of AI. We run a comprehensive AI program called Tokenizer which aims to help the community in this region benefit from AI.

I moved to Noosa, QLD from Silicon Valley where I had run a mobile startup spun out of Lonely Planet where I spent the previous 5 years as an exec leading mobile & innovation. I had a 10 year career before that in tech startups.

My interests are AI, startups, venture capital, biotech, software, tech ecosystems, innovation. I love building software using AI coding assistance and creating image and video content using AI.
