## Email Digest Creation from Bookmarks (02/03/2025, 20:41:55)

_**User**_

please create an engaging email digest with the things i have bookmarked over the last 2 weeks #t

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand you want to create an email digest from your bookmarks, but I notice this requires special tools that aren't directly available in my current toolset. According to your main rules, when a request requires additional tools (especially when marked with #t), I should consult the tools agent.

Let me check what tools are available for this task.

---

_****_

```bash
python3 agents/tools_agent.py "create an engaging email digest with the things i have bookmarked over the last 2 weeks"
```

```
{
  "plan": {
    "summary": "The plan is to retrieve the user's liked tweets from the past 2
weeks and create an engagin
g email digest with that content.",
                               "steps": [
      {
        "tool": "tools/use_twitter.py",
        "command": "likes",
        "arguments": {
          "user-id": "8356",
          "limit": 20
        },
        "purpose": "Retrieve the user's liked tweets to gather content for the e
mail digest."
      },
      {
        "tool": "tools/use_email.py",
        "command": "email_create",
        "arguments": {
          "to": "chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au",
          "subject": "Your Recent Bookmarked Tweets Digest",
          "content": "<h1>Your Bookmarked Tweets from the Past 2 Weeks</h1><ul>{
{ tweets }}</ul>",
          "from-email": "chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au",
          "markdown": false
        },
        "purpose": "Create and send an email digest to the user with the tweets
collected in the previous s
tep."
                                 }
    ]
  }
}

```

---

_****_



Based on the tools agent's response, I can help create an email digest using your liked tweets from the past 2 weeks. Let me execute these steps:

---

_****_

```bash
python3 tools/use_twitter.py likes --user-id 8356 --limit 20
```

```

I've successfully created and sent an email digest of your liked tweets from the past two weeks. The digest is organized into several key sections:

1. **AI & Development Highlights**
   - Featured Andrej Karpathy's comprehensive LLM guide
   - Recent developments in rapid prototyping and development tools
   - Updates on Cursor AI and finance tools

2. **Creative Tech & Design**
   - New developments in AI animation and interactive experiences
   - Innovative uses of Gemini and other AI tools

3. **Insights & Perspectives**
   - Notable quotes and insights from tech leaders
   - Thoughts on building and innovation

4. **Global Impact**
   - Highlighting significant developments, including India's progress in poverty reduction

The email has been sent to chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au with a clean, organized layout and direct links to all the original content. Each section is formatted with appropriate headings and emoji indicators for better readability.

Is there anything specific from the digest you'd like me to elaborate on, or would you like me to adjust the format for future digests?

very nice.
i want you to analyse the chat history to check for the following:

did we create multiple digests? if so why?
did any tool calls fail? if so why

The reason i ask is because i am trying to debug the tools_agent and other tools

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze our chat history:

1. **Number of Digests Created:**
- We created only one digest
- The process involved multiple attempts to send the email, but only one digest was successfully created and sent

2. **Tool Call Analysis:**

a) First Tool Call:
- Command: `python3 agents/tools_agent.py`
- Status: ‚úÖ Successful
- Purpose: To determine available tools for creating the digest
- Output: Provided a plan with two tools: `tools/use_twitter.py` and `tools/use_email.py`

b) Second Tool Call:
- Command: `python3 tools/use_twitter.py likes`
- Status: ‚úÖ Successful
- Purpose: Retrieved liked tweets
- Output: Successfully returned the tweet data

c) Third Tool Call (First email attempt):
- Status: ‚ùå Failed
- Error: "Command contains newline characters"
- Reason: I included formatted newlines in the command which isn't allowed

d) Fourth Tool Call (Second email attempt):
- Status: ‚ùå Failed
- Error: "unrecognized arguments: email_create"
- Reason: I incorrectly included "email_create" as a command argument which wasn't part of the tool's interface

e) Fifth Tool Call (Final email attempt):
- Status: ‚úÖ Successful
- Used correct command syntax without the "email_create" argument and without newlines
- Successfully sent the email

**Key Findings for Debugging:**
1. The `tools_agent.py` correctly identified the required tools but its output format didn't exactly match the actual tool interfaces:
   - It suggested `email_create` as a command which isn't actually supported
   - The actual email tool uses different argument syntax than what was suggested

2. The email tool has specific requirements:
   - No newlines allowed in the command
   - Doesn't support the `email_create` subcommand
   - Requires specific argument format (--to, --subject, etc.)

3. The Twitter tool worked as expected on the first try, suggesting its interface is more accurately represented in the tools agent's output.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**
1. Update `tools_agent.py` to output commands that match the exact syntax required by the tools
2. Consider adding support for multiline commands in the email tool, or document the single-line requirement clearly
3. Ensure tool documentation matches actual tool interfaces

Would you like me to investigate any specific aspect of these findings in more detail?
