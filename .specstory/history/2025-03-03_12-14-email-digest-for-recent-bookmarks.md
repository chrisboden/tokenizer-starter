# Response 1

I'll help you create an email digest of your recent bookmarks. However, I notice that I'll need to use some specialized tools to access your bookmark data. Let me first check what tools are available to help with this task.

Let me run a command to check what tools we have available for this task.

```bash
python3 agents/tools_agent.py "create an email digest of recent bookmarks"
```

```

Text: In the limit, you can boil abundance down to three principles:
1. Get the price of things as close to the cost of their raw materials as possible
2. Drive the cost of those raw materials down to the energy to extract them
3. Create new things that can do different stuff

Repeat!

I see the issue - let me read the file content first and then send it:

Now let me try sending the email again with the content:

I apologize for the error. Let me try one more time with the content properly escaped:

I've completed the task of creating and sending your bookmark digest. Here's what I did:

1. Retrieved your recent Twitter likes using the Twitter tool
2. Created a well-organized digest in `notes/bookmark_digest_2024_03_02.md`, categorizing the content by topic
3. Successfully sent the digest as a markdown-formatted email to your address

The digest includes your recent Twitter interactions organized into several categories:
- AI & Technology (including Cursor IDE updates and AI development)
- Science & Philosophy
- API & Development
- Business & Innovation
- Notable Media

You should receive the email shortly at chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au. Is there anything else you'd like me to add to or modify in the digest?

_**User**_

please add a tip to the doc string in the email tool to prevent the error you made from occuring in the future
