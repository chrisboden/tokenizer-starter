## Email Digest for Bookmarked Content (02/03/2025, 18:02:44)

_**User**_

please create an engaging email digest with the things i have bookmarked over the last 2 weeks

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create an engaging email digest with your recent bookmarks. First, I need to check if there are any tools available that might help me retrieve your bookmarked content.

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory tools ‚Ä¢ **7** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| üìÑ `use_email.py` |
| üìÑ `README.md` |
| üìÑ `manifest.json` |
| üìÑ `use_twitter.py` |
| üìÑ `use_linkedin.py` |
| üìÑ `manifest.py` |
| üìÑ `use_knowledge.py` |

</details>

Let me check the manifest.json file to understand what tools are available for retrieving bookmark data:

---

_****_

Read file: tools/manifest.json

---

Let me continue reading the manifest to find any bookmark-related tools:

Let me continue reading to see more about the likes/bookmarks functionality:

Let me check if there are any other bookmark-related tools in the manifest:

Let me check the final part of the manifest:

---

Read file: tools/manifest.json

Based on my review of the available tools, I can see that there are a few options for retrieving bookmark data:

1. Twitter likes - The user uses Twitter favorites as bookmarks for interesting content
2. LinkedIn - Could potentially have bookmarked content
3. Knowledge base - May contain saved documents

Let me first retrieve the Twitter likes, as they're explicitly mentioned as bookmarks:

---

_****_

```bash
python tools/use_twitter.py likes --user-id 8356 --limit 20
```

```
python tools/use_twitter.py likes --user-id 8356 --limit 20
chrisboden@Chriss-MacBook-Pro tokenizer % python tools/use_twitter.py likes --us
er-id 8356 --limit 20
zsh: command not found: python
chrisboden@Chriss-MacBook-Pro tokenizer %
```

---

_****_



Let me try with python3 instead:

---

_****_

```bash
python3 tools/use_twitter.py likes --user-id 8356 --limit 20
```

```

I've organized them into categories to help you quickly find what interests you most.\n\n## AI & Machine Learning Innovations\n\n### Gemini 2.0 Capabilities\n**Paige Bailey (@DynamicWebPaige)** demonstrated how Gemini 2.0 in Google AI Studio combined with VS Code and Marp can revolutionize slide deck creation. By simply providing a website and some design guidance, she created a ready-made multimodal slide deck from a Google DeepMind blogpost. This workflow could save significant time in your presentation preparations.\n\n**Tina Tarighian (@tinaz0ne)** built an impressive experiment combining Gemini 2.0 Flash with MediaPipe to turn her hand into a context-aware puppet. The system detects when her hand is open, captures webcam images in real-time, and uses Gemini to analyze the environment and generate relevant thoughts.\n\n### Practical AI Applications\n**Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy)** released a comprehensive 2-hour YouTube video titled \"How I Use LLMs\" that follows up on his previous content about how LLMs are trained. This practical guide covers the entire LLM ecosystem with examples from his own life.\n\n**Baseten (@basetenco)** shared a humorous video about \"inference\" in AI, highlighting how technical terminology can be both confusing and intriguing to newcomers in the field.\n\n## Development Tools & Techniques\n\n**Aakash Gupta (@aakashg0)** demonstrated prototyping 5 features in just 84 minutes using Bolt, Cursor, Lovable, Replit, and v0 in a podcast with Colin Matthews. This serves as a complete tutorial on top AI-powered development tools.\n\n**Ted Werbel (@tedx_ai)** showcased two Cursor agents working on one project, promising a tutorial on making this workflow even better. This could be particularly relevant for your work at the Digital Hub.\n\n**Daniel Petho (@nonzeroexitcode)** released a tool on fancycomponents.dev that animates text along an SVG path, allowing for custom animations, easings, and scroll-based animation.\n\n## Data Science & Finance\n\n**Quant Science (@quantscience_)** highlighted a free Finance database containing 300,000 tickers, which could be a valuable resource for financial analysis using Python.\n\n## Creative Technology\n\n**Pauric Freeman (@pfree05)** shared an impressive audiovisual type study using generative art and TouchDesigner, showcasing the intersection of typography and electronic music.\n\n**Fofr (@fofrAI)** demonstrated the capabilities of Wan 2.1 14b text-to-video model on Replicate, generating realistic videos of a tiger performing BMX tricks at the Olympics from a simple prompt.\n\n## Business Insights\n\n**Hiten Shah (@hnshah)** shared an inspirational message about how the world is built by those who build, not by thinkers, planners, or critics on the sidelines.\n\n**Lulu Cheng Meservey (@lulumeservey)** offered strategic advice: \"If you're outnumbered, out of your comfort zone, and have no leverage, never never allow things to turn adversarial.\"\n\n## Technology & Innovation News\n\n**Aaron Levie (@levie)** noted that after well over a hundred years of incremental progress, transportation is about to change very quickly, sharing an image of various transportation innovations.\n\n**Santiago Pliego (@SantsPliego)** shared a speech by Isaiah P. Taylor at the Ward Zero unveiling, discussing how to accomplish in 10 months what should take 4 years, and for $12M what should cost $100M.\n\n**Shashank Joshi (@shashj)** highlighted positive economic news from India, where recent surveys show only 1% of households fell below the international poverty line in 2024, effectively eliminating extreme poverty.\n\n**Australian Space Agency (@AusSpaceAgency)** announced that Varda Space successfully returned its W-2 capsule to Southern Launch's Koonibba Test Range in South Australia, marking the first commercial return on Australian soil and the first commercial return to a commercial spaceport globally.\n\n## Emerging Services\n\n**Firecrawl (@firecrawl_dev)** announced their Deep Research API, a complete research solution that allows developers to easily build deep research capabilities into applications.\n\n**Marc Lou (@marc_louvion)** shared information about a library of 50 ad templates for Meta ads that can be copied and pasted, created by someone named Nico who generated $30,000 in revenue.\n\n## Unusual Content\n\n**Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli)** created an unusual half-hour episode where he acts with an AI voice assistant called @sesame, arresting it for drug trafficking and documenting its reactions.\n\n## How This Can Help Your Work\n\nMany of these bookmarks align with the Tokenizer program's focus on AI, automation, and technology innovation. The development tools and AI applications could provide inspiration for workshops and mentoring sessions at the Peregian Digital Hub.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more information on any of these topics or if you'd like me to prepare a more detailed analysis of specific items for your upcoming events or initiatives.\n\nBest regards,\nYour AI Assistant" --markdown

_**User**_

you created 2 emails, the first was good, the second was not. the first one involved creating an md file the second you did not. i want you to look through the chat history to try to understand your thought process and how we can improve the instructions


---

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze what happened with the two email attempts to understand the issue and how we can improve the instructions.

Let me review the chat history to understand my thought process:

---

_****_

Read file: tools/use_email.py

---

_****_



Let me check the command line arguments for the email tool:

---

_****_

Read file: tools/use_email.py

---

_****_



Now I understand what happened. Let me analyze the issue:

1. **First Attempt**: I tried to use the command with `email_create` as a subcommand:
   ```
   python3 tools/use_email.py email_create --to chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au --subject "..." --content "..." --markdown
   ```
   This failed because the tool doesn't accept `email_create` as a subcommand. The error message showed: `use_email.py: error: unrecognized arguments: email_create`

2. **Second Attempt**: I corrected the command by removing the `email_create` subcommand:
   ```
   python3 tools/use_email.py --to chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au --subject "..." --content "..." --markdown
   ```
   This worked and sent the email successfully.

The confusion arose because:

1. In the manifest.json file, the command was listed as `email_create` under the `use_email.py` tool, which made me think it should be used as a subcommand.

2. However, looking at the actual implementation in `use_email.py`, the tool doesn't use subcommands - it directly accepts arguments like `--to`, `--subject`, etc.

3. The `TOOL_METADATA` in the file defines a function named `email_create`, but this appears to be metadata for documentation or integration purposes, not an actual subcommand.

To improve the instructions, we should:

1. **Clarify Command Structure**: Update the manifest.json to make it clear that `email_create` is not a subcommand but the name of the function/capability provided by `use_email.py`.

2. **Provide Clear Examples**: Include explicit examples in the documentation showing the correct command format:
   ```
   python3 tools/use_email.py --to recipient@example.com --subject "Subject" --content "Content" --markdown
   ```

3. **Align Documentation with Implementation**: Ensure that the manifest.json description matches how the tool is actually implemented.

4. **Add Error Handling**: Enhance the tool to provide more helpful error messages if someone tries to use it with `email_create` as a subcommand.

5. **Consider Command Consistency**: If other tools in the system use subcommands, consider making all tools consistent in their command structure.

The first email attempt failed due to this misunderstanding of the command structure, but the content was well-prepared. The second attempt succeeded in sending the email but didn't involve creating an MD file first (I directly included the content in the command).

Would you like me to suggest specific updates to the manifest.json or the tool implementation to make this clearer for future use?

---

_**User**_

fix the tool itself so there is no confusion

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll fix the `use_email.py` tool to eliminate confusion by making it accept both formats - with and without the `email_create` subcommand. This will make it more consistent with how it's documented in the manifest.json.

First, let me examine the full tool implementation:

---

_****_

Read file: tools/use_email.py

---

_****_





Let me check the rest of the file:

---

_****_

Read file: tools/use_email.py

Now I'll modify the tool to accept both command formats. Here's my implementation plan:
