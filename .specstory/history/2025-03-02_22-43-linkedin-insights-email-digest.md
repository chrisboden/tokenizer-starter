Text: 50 AI builders in the house to listen to the mad ravings of a janitor about how new Agentic AI tools 
like Cursor allow a knowledge worker to build AI knowledge workers that do the knowledge work.

That and 6 other big ideas that set the stage for 2025:

1. Stay upstream of AI's impact, not downstream where it 'happens to you'. To get a handle on the future, s
wim upstream to the people inventing it. My go-to sense-makers on the agentic future: Satya Nadella, Jensen
 Huang, Bret Taylor - seek them out on excellent podcasts like Dwarkesh Podcast, Bg2 Pod, No Priors, Invest
 like the best

2. "AI simultaneously lowers the floor and raises the ceiling" - Satya Nadella. 
PS: His recent podcast with Dwarkesh Patel is probably the best prediction for the future of knowledge work
 you can find right now. PS: you'll want buy MSFT straight after listening to that. My provocation to Hub f
ounders: what could you build that simultaneously lowers the floor: ie it allows non-experts to achieve exp
ert level results; while at the same time enabling experts to be much more ambitious with their project goa
ls?

3. Recursive self-improvement: As we saw with Moore's law, each new generation of chips got used in the com
puters that designed the next generation of chips which got used in the computers that designed the next, e
tc. It resulted in 50 years of exponential compute improvement. AI seems to now be exhibiting recursive sel
f-improvement, ie the current generation model helps train the next generation model which helps train the
next generation model, etc. And likely soon contribute to the ML research for the next gen algorithm, etc.
My provocation to Hub founders: what can you build that harnesses this property of recursive-self improveme
nt and how do you make that core to your product/service.

4. AI allows the notion of a "10x Developer" to be extended to other job categories not previously though o
f in those terms. Eg the 10x admin person, event manager, etc. My provocation: What job categories that are
 currently 1x, could you use Ai to create the 10x employee. Hat tip Andrew Birt

5. Service as a Software. AI flips the script on the previous SaaS era. Provocation: what labour-intensive 
service could you turn into software.
Hat tip Brian Halligan Pat Grady 

6. "You don't learn then start. You start then learn". Never been truer with the floor being lowered and th
e ceiling being raised and an endlessly patient tutor at your disposal to teach you anything. Hat tip: Sahi
l Lavingia Bojan Tunguz, Ph.D.

Thanks Steven Ringo for the impromptu vibe coding demo

Text: The Hub has become a real hotspot for AI Builders and Creatives. 

You can go from a morning coffee conversation with a founder who is re-imagining how things are done in a g
iven sector like Pip Bingemann with creative agencies, Damien Verrinder with industrial plants, Simon Lenoi
r with SME expense management, and Andrew Birt with insurance; to lunch in Peregian Beach village with an e
xpert AI technologists like Ian Hansel and Greg Freeman and Alice B. who are deep in the weeds of knowledge
 management and workflow automation.

Then you can walk into the AI Lab and be wowed by Hing Ang and Esther de Schone filming something against t
he LED wall in the Wonder Pod then using AI video engine to create a new short, then bump into our other Hu
b residents Oscar Lloyd teaching someone how to use an AI coding tool or Lincoln Knight 🎬 teaching someone
 how to use AI to edit their podcast.

Members needing AI help or advice can book office hours with our US summer migrants, Jeff Bowen and Jason T
oevs who do a residence at the Hub each summer and assist with our young inventor and other programs.

Each week we have an AI deep dive workshop for our members and there's at least one evening meetup, like th
e highly anticipated skills workshop below, from one our digital ecosystem networks, helping their members
understand how they can benefit from AI in their sector.

Such an exciting time to be in tech (and at the Hub).

Text: Tesla manufactures over 6,000 cars a day. 
Six. Thousand. Finished. Cars. A. Day! 

To get to that incredible level of scale, they created the 'machine that makes the machine': the gigafactor
y. It takes in raw materials and outputs cars. It's not treated like a factory, it's treated like a product
 to optimise, shifting the focus from car design to revolutionising production systems.

I think we're seeing something similar going on with software development. Modern AI coding tools, like Cur
sor, are transforming coders into architects of code-producing systems: ie software developers now make sof
tware¹ that makes software².

This new paradigm shifts engineering focus from writing code to building meta-systems (Coding Agents) that 
generate, verify, and deploy software autonomously - the machines that make the machines. As the underlying
 models improve, you can make better Coding agents that make better software.

In this instance the software¹ being created is mostly written in English (or other natural language), in t
he form of 'prompts' that contain rules, product requirements, diagrams, examples, tests, guardrails, api d
ocumentation, onboarding guides, etc.

There are currently estimated to be around 30m programmers globally
There are 1̶.̶5̶b̶n̶ ̶E̶n̶g̶l̶i̶s̶h̶ ̶s̶p̶e̶a̶k̶e̶r̶s̶ ̶ 6.5bn natural language speaking adults

So when software can be generated using a programming language called 'English' (or Spanish or Mandarin) - 
it massively increases the addressable market for 'developer tools'. That's probably why Cursor is the fast
est growing SaaS company of all time, growing from 1m to $100m annual revenue in roughly 12 months.

A key factor driving Moore's Law (doubling of compute performance every couple of years) was that each new 
generation of chips was used to develop the next generation of chips. This is known as recursive self-impro
vement and it drives exponential effects. You can now also see it with the development of OpenAI's models w
here gpt-4o is used to train o1 which is used to train o3 and o3 is used to train o4 and so on.

We're now seeing this recursive self-improvement happen to software development: as the underlying AI model
s improve, you can make better Coding Agents which make better software. Example: Cursor have used their ow
n AI coding tool to make an AI coding tool that generates $100m, with only 20 employees!

At last week's Coding from Beach meetup, we onboarded 60 technologists to the Cursor coding tool and the wo
rld of AI-assisted coding.

For those interested in learning more about this paradigm shift, here are my slides from that session: http

Text: Another fantastic evening at the Peregian Digital Hub's Coding from the Beach! Easily one of my favor
ite meetups, where complete beginners, juniors, and seniors all walk away having learned something new.

This time, we explored Cursor, a company doing some seriously impressive work in bringing LLM-powered agent
s to software development. The potential here is massive, not just for improving efficiency, but for fundam
entally changing the way we code.

I especially loved how Chris Boden described these AI agents: "Lowering the floor for beginners while raisi
ng the ceiling for advanced users." That mindset is what makes AI in dev tools so exciting. It’s not just a
bout automation, but empowering every level of developer to push further. As someone who sat more on the sk
eptical side of AI code development, I'm happy to say that the results from last night were spectacular!

Always a great time connecting with the amazing tech community here! Looking forward to the next one, where
 a wide range of people will be presenting mini-projects made in the Cursor IDE! 🖥️

Text: I'll be sharing what I've learned as an AI-assisted coder at our Coding from Beach meetup tomorrow ev
ening. Looks like there is lots of interest in the topic. The intersection of AI and coding is throwing up
new possibilities,  behaviours, and markets:

Possibilities:
What I call personal software. I've heard it called selfish software. SaaS with a market of 1. Highly esote
ric - it does things for you/your business that are unique to your workflows/preferences and would not be r
elevant to anyone else.

8090: 80% feature-complete SaaS for 90% less cost

2005: There's an app for that. 
2025: Make an app for that 
(see Replit launch today https://lnkd.in/gQADseF6).

Behaviours:
Coding as painting. Where people take up coding as they might take up painting. A form of self-expression o
r creativity. The painting is never going to hang in the Musee D'Orsay and that little app is never going t
o make a dime. Art for art's sake. Making apps for the fun of it. A new form of self-actualisation that was
 once out of reach for most people. Vibe coding: where you give full control to the AI coding agent and let
 it lead the way.

Markets:
The first one we can see emerging is that the total addressable market for 'dev tools' is growing massively
 as coding becomes accessible to more people. The tool we're learning tomorrow, Cursor, is an AI-assisted c
oding tool. Cursor is perhaps the fastest growing SaaS of all time. 0-$100m ARR in 12 months. Partly becaus
e the number of 'devs' has grown massively since AI-assisted coding became a thing. And Cursor is just one
of many great AI-assisted dev tools.

Text: Hot take: Seeing an AI's 'reasoning trace', ie its chain of thought, for the first time, as it prepar
es to give an answer, is one of those moments that makes you realise how much things are going to change.

The conventional wisdom is that as AI gets smarter, we get dumber and more reliant on AI to do the cognitiv
e heavy lifting. But these reasoning traces are the most valuable things of all - they can help you learn t
o think. Were you ever really taught how to think, how to reason?

When you get an answer to your question from an AI, you are getting utility that helps you complete a task,
 but when you get the reasoning trace that led to the answer, you are getting a new form of education. This
 could really help make everyone smarter.

I've loved having JD building this out of the Hub  - it's been like having a direct line to all of the inte
resting things happening in global affairs and an in-house expert to help us make sense of what's going on.
 That's apparently how subscribers of Intrigue feel too - their daily newsletter is growing like a weed amo

Text: I'm predicting that we're going to see an explosion in the supply of new products and services, becau
se AI and robotics will make it easier and cheaper to create new things. Human attention is inelastic by co
mparison.

With more products and services competing for a relatively fixed amount of human attention, it's going to g
et increasingly expensive to find and convert customers to whatever thing it is that you're offering.

I therefore find it incredibly valuable to listen to founders like Gary Tramer who have cracked the code of
 how to get customers without breaking the bank. It includes clever branding,  compelling social media, sop
histicated performance marketing, and a touch of celebrity. Enjoy this chat between Gary and our friend Cob

Text: The Springboards.ai origin story reminds me of the classic Chris Dixon blog, written in 2010, about h
ow big things often start out looking like toys (see more below). In this clip you'll hear how Pip Bingeman
n used the early Midjourney and ChatGPT products like a toy to create fantasy brands he could share on Link
edin.

------

The next big thing will start out looking like a toy
2010-01-03
Chris Dixon
 
"Disruptive technologies are dismissed as toys because when they are first launched they “undershoot” user 
needs. The first telephone could only carry voices a mile or two. The leading telco of the time, Western Un
ion, passed on acquiring the phone because they didn’t see how it could possibly be useful to businesses an
d railroads – their primary customers. What they failed to anticipate was how rapidly telephone technology
and infrastructure would improve (technology adoption is usually non-linear due to so-called complementary
network effects). The same was true of how mainframe companies viewed the PC (microcomputer), and how moder
n telecom companies viewed Skype. (Christensen has many more examples in his books)."

"This does not mean every product that looks like a toy will turn out to be the next big thing. To distingu
ish toys that are disruptive from toys that will remain just toys, you need to look at products as processe
s. Obviously, products get better inasmuch as the designer adds features, but this is a relatively weak for
ce. Much more powerful are external forces: microchips getting cheaper, bandwidth becoming ubiquitous, mobi
le devices getting smarter, etc. For a product to be disruptive it needs to be designed to ride these chang
es up the utility curve."

"A product doesn’t have to be disruptive to be valuable. There are plenty of products that are useful from 
day one and continue being useful long term. These are what Christensen calls sustaining technologies. When
 startups build useful sustaining technologies, they are often quickly acquired or copied by incumbents. If
 your timing and execution is right, you can create a very successful business on the back of a sustaining
technology."

"But startups with sustaining technologies are very unlikely to be the new ones we see on top lists in 2020
. Those will be disruptive technologies – the ones that sneak by because people dismiss them as toys."

Text: A year ago the conventional wisdom in AI sector was that 'AI wrappers' were doomed to failure. These 
'wrappers' use API's provided by the major model providers, like Open AI, to bring new capabilities to end-
users. The thinking went that they were easy to replicate, had no competitive moat and that, as frontier mo
dels improved, they would handle those use cases.

A year later, and although it's still early days, it seems this may not be true. It looks like 'wrapper app
s' are in fact 'applied AI' - ie using the underlying AI capabilities to solve very specific problems. To d
o that well, there is a hell of a lot of domain-specific knowledge required, tooling that fits specific wor
kflows, guardrails that keep the AI on task and evals (tests) that ensure the AI is behaving as intended. A
ccording to ChatGPT 'your brain is just a wrapper around neurons firing off biochemistry'.

Anyway, one of the hottest AI 'wrappers' out there is Springboards.ai - a tool  that helps brand and market
ing creatives get to places they wouldn’t go alone by using tools that spark ideas, not dictate them. I sat
 down with co-founders Pip Bingemann and Amy Tucker to talk about how they went from freshly laid-off tech
workers with a toddler to founders of one of the hottest products in the agency land.

Text: AI-assisted coding has me building up a suite of little AI tools to help get things done. I generally
 open source them and share with our Hub members in case they could be helpful.

The latest one is inspired by NotebookLM - the AI tool from Google that has gone viral due its ability to g
enerate a realistic 2-person podcast from any documents you upload. Although that got all of the attention,
 it's the underlying app - which allows you to chat with up to 50 docs, which I've found really useful.

Yesterday I uploaded the manual for our videowall controller and asked it to help me troubleshoot a technic
al problem. Last week it helped me figure out our eligibility for a grant and prepare for podcast interview
s and many other use cases.

The real magic of NotebookLM is in the underlying Google Gemini AI model, which, compared to chatgpt & clau
de is unheralded. What makes Gemini unique (as of Oct '24) is:

1) its massive context window of 1m tokens (Gemini Flash) and 2m tokens for Gemini Pro. You could fit multi
ple full novels in a single prompt;

2) its ability to deal natively with many complex file formats. If you feed it a video, it ingests 1 frame 
a second and builds an understanding of the content - this is much more like the AI is actually 'watching'
a video and understanding it than just working off of a text transcription. Similar for pdf's - it doesn't
just scrape or parse out the text, it actually 'reads' and understands the pdf including tables, charts and
 other elements that get lost if you simply parse the text from a pdf.

My tool 'notepad' is a local and customisable version. Its core functionality being to upload pdf (and othe
r docs) and chat with them. I like to experiment with prompt engineering to try to get highly personalised
responses from LLMs. That involves adding custom instructions and other information about myself, my job an
d my org so that the LLM has better context and can tailor its outputs for me. Tools like NotebookLM hide t
he prompts behind ui because normal people don't want to fiddle with prompts.

The stack I now use for building these tools is:

Streamlit - a simple web app framework that takes python scripts and gives them a user interface. It lets y
ou focus on writing simple python scripts instead of spending time on complex front end code

Cursor - the IDE (integrated development environment) built for AI-assisted coding

OpenRouter - the LLM aggregator that lets you access almost all LLM providers (incl openai, anthropic, goog
le, perplexity, etc) from a single api gateway

OpenAI's o1-preview model is the most powerful LLM available right now and it is a very good at coding (but
 pricey). Given the right prompt, it can create an entire streamlit AI chatbot app in one-shot with zero er
rors. I usually start a new project with o1-preview which provides the scaffold and most of the code, then
I iterate with Claude Sonnet 3.5 in Cursor

Feel free to fork or clone the app

Text: Have you ever heard someone say, 'no single person knows how to make a pencil'? I have. But usually m
isquoted as a sort of frustrated example of how complex the world had become.

Where this actually comes from is the incredible essay "I, Pencil" written 66 years ago by Leonard Read, wh
ich, once you read it, changes the way you see the world. Hopefully with a greater appreciation of the role
 that freedom, markets and the invisible hand have played in our prosperity.

A quote:

"It has been said that “only God can make a tree.” Why do we agree with this? Isn’t it because we realize t
hat we ourselves could not make one? Indeed, can we even describe a tree? We cannot, except in superficial
terms. We can say, for instance, that a certain molecular configuration manifests itself as a tree. But wha
t mind is there among men that could even record, let alone direct, the constant changes in molecules that
transpire in the life span of a tree? Such a feat is utterly unthinkable!

I, Pencil, am a complex combination of miracles: a tree, zinc, copper, graphite, and so on. But to these mi
racles which manifest themselves in Nature an even more extraordinary miracle has been added: the configura
tion of creative human energies—millions of tiny know-hows configurating naturally and spontaneously in res
ponse to human necessity and desire and in the absence of any human masterminding! Since only God can make
a tree, I insist that only God could make me. Man can no more direct these millions of know-hows to bring m
e into being than he can put molecules together to create a tree."

Text: When we ran our first AI cadetship program in 2020, students had to build their own neural networks f
rom scratch to do anything fun with AI. We were very lucky to have programming prodigy Benjamin Szabo-Virag
 (13y/o at the time) teach a very bright cohort of cadets first how to program in Python then how to build
a deep Q network and train it to make a stick fighting game with 'AI' players.

Fast forward to 2024, the ChatGPT era, and in one term cadets can go from a cold start to building fully fu
nctional AI apps in 7 weeks. The thing that was most pleasing about this year's program was seeing the kids
 learn how to learn with AI. That's a huge unlock. It meant that they could use chatgpt/claude to help them
 with their coding but also to help explain concepts like API's, data structures and other things that we w
ould normally have to run classes on.

We were super impressed not only with the speed at which these cadets learned but also with the quality of 
the ideas and the creative ways in which they deployed multi-modal AI to bring their ideas to life. Thanks
to Noah Moller, an alum from our 2023 AI Cadetship, for being such a great teaching assistant.

Text: Just because you can doesn't mean you should....

I'm seeing people get excited about AI's ability to draft new policies and procedures. Yes, it's pretty goo
d at that. So, everyone should be prepared for an avalanche of new policy documents, creating even more unn
ecessary bureaucracy. That is a newbie error and is an abominable use of AI.

Fwiw, my advice is that you should use AI for the exact inverse of that. Instead, have AI reduce the number
 and length and complexity of your policy documents. Feed it all of your policy docs, have it analyse them,
 dedupe them, summarise them into the most succinct form possible and rewrite a single policy doc for grade
 10 high school student level understanding.

Text: Google's very handy NotebookLLM product added a fun new audio feature this week that's made a lot of 
people go wow. The NotebookLLM tool allows you to upload documents into a notepad/workspace and then 'chat'
 with them - eg synthesise a summary which draws from multiple policy documents.

The new audio overview feature is very cool - it uses AI to produce a 2 person audio podcast discussing the
 documents you've uploaded. The Noosa Council corporate plan is a 68 page pdf doc that is made available on
 Council's website. Here's what that document sounds like as a 7 min podcast.

Text: Came across Mr Beast Productions' onboarding guide for new staff. Loved this bit in particular (esp t
he last paragraph):

----

What is the goal of our content?

To excite me. The goal of our content is to excite me. 

That may sound weird to some of you, especially if you’re new but to me it’s what’s most important. If I'm 
not excited to get in front of that camera and film the video, it’s just simply not going to happen. I’m no
t fake and I will be authentic, that’s partly why the channel does so well. And if i’m not excited by the v
ideo, we’re ****d.

Luckily, I'd say I'm a pretty predictable guy. (at least in this regard haha) What
excites me is what I believe will make the audience happy. That’s what it always
has been and always will be. I’m willing to count to one hundred thousand, bury
myself alive, or walk a marathon in the world’s largest pairs of shoes if I must. I
just want to do what makes me happy and ultimately the viewers happy. 

This channel is my baby and I've given up my life for it. I’m so emotionally connected to it that it’s sad 
lol. But this is the one thing I will never compromise on, I have 0 issues throwing away a multi million do
llar video if I don’t think it’s up to my standards and is good for the audience.

We must always be improving and innovating. The camera angles need to always get better, the pacing, the st
ory, the jokes, the color, the lighting, the music, the props, the people, our framing, our ideas, literall
y everything must always be improving and innovating. Because that is what excites me. That’s literally wha
t I live for, to see these videos get better and better and ultimately make the viewers happy.

Text: One of my favourite business analogies is the concept of a peace dividend that emerges from intense '
wars' between competing forces or challenges

In World War II, tech like radar, jet engines, and computing were originally developed for offensive purpos
es—radar to detect enemy aircraft, jet engines to power faster military planes, and computing to break encr
ypted enemy communications. When the war ended, they became a peace dividend and were repurposed for civili
an use: radar became essential in air traffic control, jet engines for commercial aviation, and computing l
aid the foundation for the modern digital age.

I first learned this idea from Chris Anderson, ex 'Wired' editor & author of 'The Long Tail'. In 2013 he sa
id:

"The drone is basically the peace dividend of the smartphone wars, which is to say that the components in a
 smartphone — the sensors, the GPS, the camera, the ARM core processors, the wireless, the memory, the batt
ery — all that stuff, which is being driven by the incredible economies of scale and innovation machines at
 Apple, Google, and others, is available for a few dollars. They were essentially “unobtainium” 10 years ag
o. This is stuff that used to be military industrial technology; you can buy it at RadioShack now. I’ve nev
er seen technology move faster than it’s moving right now, and that’s because of the supercomputer in your
pocket."

The most recent 'war' we had was the war on COVID. The peace dividends? Remote work being normalised, mRNA 
technology revolutionising vaccines,  adoption of telemedicine, Zoom funerals as a way to connect during di
fficult times, mainstreaming of QR codes for contactless interactions, and global cold chain logistics that
 can deliver essential medicines to the most remote areas.

Right now we're in year two of the LLM war. Duking it out are OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, C
ohere, and Mistral. What was once 'unobtainium' is now intelligence 'too cheap to meter'. Each warring part
y is trying to find an edge on one or more of these dimensions:

- model intelligence (eg gpt-4 vs Llama 3.5)
- speed (measured in tokens per second)
- cost ( measured in $ per million tokens in/out)
- modalities (video, audio, image, etc)
- tool/artefact support
- openness (open source vs closed, & availability of weights)

Another is context window size. This is the amount of information an LLM can consider at once, influencing 
how well it can understand and generate responses based on longer or more complex inputs. As of August 2024
 the winner on this dimension is Google with their Gemini Pro model. Its incredible 2 million token context
 window makes it possible to have prompts that are equivalent in size to the complete text of ten novels.

This last month, we've been showing Hub members how to create huge prompts with detailed info about their b
usinesses to help them do > 80% of the heavy lifting on any RFP response. Next week we'll share that knowle
dge with our digital marketing community...

Text: Notes from my talk at Coding from Beach last week for folks that are working with AI:

1. Burning Platform
The theme of the moment at the Hub is 'Upstream' - ie how do we keep ourselves and our companies upstream o
f AI. Downstream is where AI happens to you. The recent Klarna customer service trial and stats are a canar
y in the coalmine (as are tech layoffs). https://lnkd.in/gUeaXPRM

2. Get upstream
The only way we know to stay upstream is remain curious and seek new knowledge:
- Building our Skills (eg getting good at prompting, making GPT's)
- Experimenting with new ideas (eg automating tasks using AI)
- Sharing learnings (eg sharing prompts, gpts, articles, tools, podcasts, tutorials with eachother)
- Making stuff (eg making basic prototypes using tools like Google Colab, and using ChatGPT's coding abilit
ies to help make things)

3. LLM State of Play
It felt like a plateau of hype and consumer usage over last 6 months. But don't take your eye off the ball 
because in that time the Llm landscape has changed massively:

OPEN AI
After Board trouble in Nov, OAI went quiet but there have been some recent product improvements. ChatGPT co
nsumers can now add things to its memory. Similar to custom instructions, this radically improves its respo
nses, as memory is persisted across chats. You can also @ mention your custom GPTs from the main chat box a
nd use inline during conversation.

Developers can now access 128k context windows (equivalent of 2 novels). Assistants API now streams respons
es and there is a batch API for large data augmentation workloads.

----

However, OpenAI is no longer the only game in town. There is huge competition in the LLM space now and the 
winners are consumers & developers with things getting better, cheaper and faster.

OpenAI now have major competition on both consumer and developer fronts: Consumers can now use Meta AI (bui
lt into Whatsapp, Instagram, etc), M365 Copilot (Microsoft), Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic), and Poe (
Quora).  Developers in turn now have access to a much wider variety of GPT-4 class models from the above pl
us Cohere, Mistral and many others.

The major story however is the open sourcing of Lllama3 by Meta. So far we have 8b and 70b parameter models
 available which are proving to be excellent. The 8b model runs locally on pc with upwards of GPT 3.5 quali
ty. A 400b parameter model is still in training and is likely to exceed GPT4 capabilities. These models hav
e already been finetuned and upgraded by the open source community with many new variants daily.

When there is a proliferation of options, there is a need for aggregators. New players like Groq.com (whose
 special chips generate instant responses) and openrouter.ai , can host these open source models and offer
them at a fraction of the price of OpenAI & other closed models. Better, cheaper faster.

Text: This is Meta's new Llama3 AI running locally on my computer (M1 Mac). This is the 8b parameter model,
 which, on the LLM leaderboard, currently ranked in 15th position. This is ahead of GPT3.5-turbo which many
 of us used for the first 6 months or more of ChatGPT.

The speed and quality of response is amazing but the thing that really blows my mind is that this model is 
about 4GB in size. You could ask it any question you could conceive of and it will give you a pretty good a
nswer. It was trained on 15 trillion tokens (words). I'll say it again, it is an absolute miracle of comput
er science that the entire corpus of human knowledge can be compressed into a 4gb file.

As Sam Altman says 'we took rocks, added electrons and got intelligence'. 

Never lose faith in our species' ability to create miracles.

Text: In 2007 Marc Andreesen wrote that the life of any startup can be divided into two parts: before produ
ct/market fit and after product-market fit. The only thing that matters, he wrote, is getting to product-ma
rket fit.

The Lean Startup approach pioneered by Steve Blank and popularised by Eric Ries then provided the howto pla
ybook for finding 'PMF' in the most capital-efficient way possible. There's now an amazing set of tools ava
ilable these days that help apply 'lean' and find PMF. Some of my favourites are Ash Maurya's Running Lean
book (& lean canvas), Dan Olsen's Lean Product Playbook, Rob Fitzpatrick's The Mom Test, Colin Bryar's Work
ing Backwards, and Scott Brown's (C)lean Messaging.
 
Mark Lamb put me onto this excellent new framework created by First Round Capital called 'Levels' that help
s identify what level of product-market fit a given startup has, and aims to help founders find it faster.
This is red meat for anyone who nerds out on startups and there are a few gems worth sharing

"When we picture product-market fit, we see three distinct building blocks:
Four Levels: Nascent, Developing, Strong, Extreme Product-Market Fit
Three Dimensions: Satisfaction, Demand, Efficiency
Levers: Change your persona, your problem, your promise, or your product (our version of the 4Ps) to make t
he work of finding, winning, serving and retaining your marginal customer easier."

The levels are the level of PMF a startup has. 
The dimensions are the key metrics that indicate your level. 
The levers are what you can pull to get unstuck on the path to product-market fit. 

I particularly like the the practicality of the levers & the case studies they share for each:

The persona: Who would benefit most from your insight? Do you have a person in a specific type of role or f
unction who faces a set of challenges in mind? In this context, the persona can be the buyer (CTO or CRO),
the company type (e.g. Fortune 10,000 financial services) or both. Consider whether it’s too narrow, too br
oad — or needs to be abandoned altogether.
The problem: Is this an urgent and important problem that your target persona has? It’s the classic painkil
ler versus vitamin question. You’re looking to solve a problem that is urgent and, if solved, will provide
huge relief to your potential customers. If not, you may need to explore adjacent problems for your persona
, or rethink your persona and problem entirely.
The promise: Are those customers interested in what you’ll do to address that need — your unique value prop
osition? It’s easy to confuse this for your actual product, but the promise is how you communicate the bene
fit your product will deliver. In our experience, this is the lever that is most overlooked.
The product: Will the product that you’re building actually deliver on this promise? Are customers interest
ed in this particular solution to their problem? Would they pay for it?

Text: Monumental Labs gave a great demo of their robotic stone-carving technology this week at Stripe Sessi
ons. I very much look forward to using the tech in the near future to create the Michaelangelo-esque master
piece that I've been conceptualising for some years - "weary middle-aged Dad unpacks dishwasher again" - an
d have that installed at the Louvre.

Aside from their cool tech, it was their mission that really caught my eye: 
"to unleash a renaissance". 

It's become very unfashionable to be excited about the future. I for one think there's nothing more excitin
g than the heralding of a "new renaissance" or seeing us become "a multiplanetary species". Bring it on.

Text: This stat about Picasso blew my mind: 

Picasso lived for a total of 33,403 days. 

With 26,075 published works that means 

Picasso averaged 1 new piece of artwork every day of his life from age 20 until his dearth at 91. 

He created something new, every day, for 71 years.

Text: Most of the world's installed base of industrial robots were bought at great cost and deployed in the
 pre-ChatGPT era. They are mechanically brilliant at what they do but have no intelligence - ie they have t
o be precisely programmed to do a very specific repetitive task. If you want to get the robot to pick and p
lace the round one instead of the square one, you need to bring in the system integrators at $10k a day to
program that variation in their behaviour - 21st century machines with 20th century brains.

What if you could upgrade those robots to have brains, eyes, ears and voices like chatgpt so that you could
 get them to do a wider variety of tasks with natural language commands rather than very rigid commands pro
grammed by very expensive consultants? Peek into our former kitchen at the AI Lab and you'll see a couple o
f mad scientists, Ken Macken and Richard Pruss upgrading the brains of a couple of industrial robots, soon
to be many more. I for one welcome our industrial robot overlords.

Text: Every young person asking "What should I do with my life?" should read Paul Graham's brilliant new es
say "How to Start Google." With his customary wisdom and wit, PG maps out a path for turning youthful curio
sity into creating something extraordinary.

His core advice is basically: get good at technology by working on your own passion projects in areas you'r
e genuinely interested in. "Don't try to guess whether gene editing or AI or rockets will be most valuable,
" he writes. "Just work on whatever interests you the most. You'll work much harder on something you're int
erested in."

Immersing in hands-on projects accelerates learning and creative growth like nothing else. PG's insights on
 generating startup ideas from this maker mindset also hit home: "Once you're good at technology, you start
 to see opportunities everywhere - dotted outlines around the things that are missing...each one a potentia
l startup."

Two other quotes that hit home:

"If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work and it replied with a single word, my bet would be o
n 'curiosity.'" My current goto on this is recommending the use of the Perplexity app - a new breed of answ
er engines (vs search engines). For curious people, Perplexity does great job of taking you down a rabbit h
ole of whatever you may be interested in learning about by prompting you with suggested questions to follow
 up on. This helps solve the "don't know what you don't know" problem.

The other is "Original ideas don't come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build 
or understand something slightly too difficult."

By nurturing curiosity and a love for building from a young age, we can inspire the next generation of entr
epreneurs who will create the things that shape our future.

Read the full essay at https://lnkd.in/gajMuEhM. As PG advises: "Begin by trying the simplest thing that co
uld possibly work. Surprisingly often, it does."

Text: The screen sector on the Coast is pumping. The Screen Collective have been doing the hard yards for 5
 years to identify the talent in the region (many of whom work remotely from home) by putting on world clas
s events like this and the Showdown program which has become a fantastic incubator for screen talent.

This grassroots industry work on the "soft infrastructure" is laying the groundwork for the Sunshine Coast 
to become a key destination for the future of filmmaking and making an incredibly strong case to secure the
 investment and support for the "hard infrastructure" of a world class studio complex in the next few years
. Exciting times.

+ # LinkedIn Insights Digest - February 2024
+ 
+ ## Executive Summary
+ A compilation of key insights and discussions from Chris Boden's LinkedIn activity during February 2024, focusing on AI, technology, and innovation at the Peregian Digital Hub.
+ 
+ ## Key Themes and Insights
+ 
+ ### 1. AI's Impact on Knowledge Work and Creativity
+ - **AI as an Accelerator**: AI tools are best viewed as accelerators rather than replacements for human creativity, particularly in creative agency work.
+ - **Wrapper Apps and Applied AI**: The conventional wisdom about 'AI wrappers' being doomed has been challenged. Success in applied AI requires significant domain-specific knowledge, specialized tooling, and carefully designed guardrails.
+ 
+ ### 2. The Evolution of AI Tools and Capabilities
+ - **Cursor IDE Success**: Cursor has become one of the fastest-growing SaaS companies, reaching $100M annual revenue in roughly 12 months.
+ - **AI-Assisted Development**: The paradigm shift in software development where coders are becoming architects of code-producing systems.
+ - **Accessibility**: Programming is becoming more accessible as software can be generated using natural language commands.
+ 
+ ### 3. Community and Education Impact
+ - **AI Cadetship Progress**: Significant advancement in AI education, with students now able to build fully functional AI apps in 7 weeks, compared to earlier years when building neural networks from scratch was necessary.
+ - **Learning with AI**: Students are effectively using tools like ChatGPT/Claude not just for coding but also for understanding complex concepts like APIs and data structures.
+ 
+ ### 4. Digital Hub Activities
+ - **Coding from Beach Meetup**: Successful session on AI-assisted coding using the Cursor IDE, with 60 technologists participating in the onboarding.
+ - **Community Engagement**: Strong participation from various groups including students, staff, and parents from St Andrew's Anglican College, demonstrating the Hub's role in fostering tech education.
+ 
+ ### 5. Future Outlook
+ - **AI Development Paradigm**: Emphasis on the shift from traditional coding to building meta-systems (Coding Agents) that generate, verify, and deploy software autonomously.
+ - **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Recognition of how each generation of AI tools helps develop the next, similar to how Moore's Law drove computing advancement.
+ 
+ ## Notable Quotes
+ > "AI simultaneously lowers the floor and raises the ceiling" - Satya Nadella
+ > Referenced in discussion about how AI tools make technology more accessible while enabling experts to be more ambitious.
+ 
+ ## Action Items and Opportunities
+ 1. Explore the potential of AI-assisted coding through tools like Cursor
+ 2. Consider participating in upcoming Hub events and workshops
+ 3. Stay informed about the evolving landscape of AI tools and their applications
+ 4. Engage with the local tech community through regular meetups and sessions
+ 
+ ## Upcoming Events (as mentioned in February posts)
+ - AI Skills Program: Tokenizer (Expression of interest open)
+ - Regular Coding from Beach meetups
+ - Continued AI education and community engagement activities
+ 
+ ---
+ *This digest was compiled from LinkedIn posts shared by Chris Boden during February 2024. For more information about the Peregian Digital Hub and its activities, visit our website or connect with us on LinkedIn.*

I've created a comprehensive email digest summarizing your LinkedIn posts from February 2024. The digest is organized into several key sections:

1. Executive Summary
2. Key Themes and Insights (broken down into 5 main areas)
3. Notable Quotes
4. Action Items and Opportunities
5. Upcoming Events

The digest focuses on the major themes from your February posts, particularly around:
- AI's role in knowledge work and creativity
- The evolution of AI tools and capabilities
- Community and education impact
- Digital Hub activities
- Future outlook for AI and technology

The file has been saved as `notes/linkedin_digest_feb_2024.md`. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the content or structure of the digest?

---

_**User**_

where's the email

---

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for the confusion. I created the content in markdown format but didn't actually create and send an email. Let me use the email tool to send this digest.

---

_****_

```bash
python3 tools/use_email.py --to chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au --subject "LinkedIn Insights Digest - February 2024" --content "$(cat notes/linkedin_digest_feb_2024.md)" --from-email chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au
```

```

Successfully sent email: LinkedIn Insights Digest - February 2024
chrisboden@Chriss-MacBook-Pro tokenizer %
```

---

_****_



I've now sent the digest via email to your address (chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au). You should receive it shortly. The email contains all the insights and analysis from the markdown file I created earlier. Is there anything specific from the digest you'd like me to explain or elaborate on?

---

_**User**_

the email shows raw markdown

---

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for sending the raw markdown. Let me convert the markdown to proper email HTML formatting and resend it.

---

_****_

I apologize for the error. Let me try a different approach. I'll create a temporary HTML file and then send it.

---

_****_

Cancelled

---

_**User**_

use the helper function in the email tool

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, let me try using the email tool's built-in markdown-to-html conversion feature.

---

_****_

```bash
python3 tools/use_email.py --to chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au --subject "LinkedIn Insights Digest - February 2024" --markdown-file notes/linkedin_digest_feb_2024.md --from-email chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au

I see the issue. Let me try with the correct parameters:

---

_****_

```bash
python3 tools/use_email.py --to chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au --subject "LinkedIn Insights Digest - February 2024" --content "$(cat notes/linkedin_digest_feb_2024.md)" --from-email chris.boden@noosa.qld.gov.au --markdown
```

```

I've now sent the email using the markdown formatting option. The content should be properly formatted in the email now, with proper headings, bullet points, and styling. Could you please check if the email looks correct this time?

---

_**User**_

we should really have inline links to the posts themselves

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right. Let me update the digest to include direct links to the LinkedIn posts for reference. I'll modify the content to include the relevant URLs from your February posts.
