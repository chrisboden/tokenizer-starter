It seems there might be an issue with the environment configuration. Let me check a few things:

1. First, let's verify if the `DESTINATION_FOLDER` environment variable is set correctly.
2. Let's check if the required directory structure exists.

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory ‚Ä¢ **14** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| üìÅ `temp` |
| üìÅ `notes` |
| üìÅ `.git` |
| üìÅ `agents` |
| üìÅ `tools` |
| üìÑ `email_digest.md` |
| üìÑ `.gitignore` |
| üìÅ `knowledge` |

| üìÅ `.cursor` |
| üìÅ `evals` |
| üìÅ `instructions` |
| üìÅ `.specstory` |

</details>

---

Let me check the `.env` file to see if the `DESTINATION_FOLDER` is properly configured:

---

_****_

Read file: .env

---

_****_



I can see several issues:

1. The `DESTINATION_FOLDER` in the `.env` file is set to `/Users/chrisboden/Dropbox/knowledgebase`, but based on the script's output, it seems to be looking in the `tokenizer` and `hub` folders.

2. The script is finding manifest entries (14 documents from tokenizer, 5 spreadsheets from tokenizer, 3 documents from hub), but it's not able to properly access the content.

Let's check if the knowledge directory exists and has the expected structure:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory knowledge ‚Ä¢ **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| üìÑ `llms.txt` |

</details>

---

_****_



I see several issues that need to be fixed:

1. The `DESTINATION_FOLDER` in the `.env` file points to a different location than where the script is finding the manifests.
2. The knowledge directory structure doesn't match what the script expects (it's looking for subdirectories like `tokenizer` and `hub` with `documents` and `spreadsheets` subdirectories).

Here's what we need to do to fix this:

1. First, let's check if the actual knowledge base exists at the configured location:

---

_****_

```bash
ls -la /Users/chrisboden/Dropbox/knowledgebase
```

```
chrisboden@Chriss-MacBook-Pro tokenizer % ls -la /Users/chrisboden/Dropbox/knowledgebase
total 88
drwxr-xr-x@  7 chrisboden  staff    224 Mar  1 23:02 .

drwxr-xr-x@  5 chrisboden  staff    160 Mar  1 23:02 tokenizer
chrisboden@Chriss-MacBook-Pro tokenizer %
```

---

Great! I can see that the knowledge base directory exists and has the correct structure with `hub` and `tokenizer` directories. Let's check the structure of one of these directories:

---

_****_

```bash
ls -la /Users/chrisboden/Dropbox/knowledgebase/tokenizer
```

```
chrisboden@Chriss-MacBook-Pro tokenizer % ls -la /Users/chrisboden/Dropbox/knowledgebase/tokenizer
total 8
drwxr-xr-x@  5 chrisboden  staff   160 Mar  1 23:02 .
drwxr-xr-x@  7 chrisboden  staff   224 Mar  1 23:02 ..
-rw-r--r--@  1 chrisboden  staff  1596 Mar  2 22:12 .sync_state.json
drwxr-xr-x@ 18 chrisboden  staff   576 Mar  2 22:11 documents
drwxr-xr-x@  9 chrisboden  staff   288 Mar  1 23:00 spreadsheets
chrisboden@Chriss-MacBook-Pro tokenizer %
```

---

_****_



Now I can see that the directory structure is correct, with `documents` and `spreadsheets` subdirectories. The script is finding the manifests but seems to be having trouble accessing the actual files.

Let's check if we can access one of the manifest files:

---

_****_

```bash
cat /Users/chrisboden/Dropbox/knowledgebase/tokenizer/documents/@manifest.json
```

Based on the investigation, I can see that the script is working as expected in terms of:
1. Finding the knowledge base directory
2. Reading the manifests
3. Selecting relevant documents

However, there seems to be an issue with accessing the actual document content. Let's check if we can access one of the selected documents:

## **Tokenizer Recap**

The Peregian Digital Hub is a public service initiative of the Noosa Council with a mandate to help build o
ut a vibrant digital sector in the region that helps bolster and diversify the local economy and, through i
ts activities, contributes to building social capital in our community.

The Hub believes that AI is likely to have a seismic impact on our region‚Äôs economy and community in the ne
ar term and that it must move quickly and proactively to deliver programs that will help the region navigat
e the opportunities and challenges that are coming.

The Tokenizer program is a modest attempt to do that. It builds on a series of experimental programs that h
ave been run at the Hub through 2023 and 2024 as AI was finding its feet with early adopters.

With funding support from the Queensland Government‚Äôs Advance QLD initiative, the Tokenizer program is an a
ttempt to put the region on the front foot with respect to AI.

Much like the internet and smartphone before it, AI is a general purpose technology that allows people and 
businesses to do things that were not previously possible.

This creates opportunity for new value creation:

* Startups can bring entirely new products and services to market that were never before possible.  
* Existing SMB‚Äôs can develop new products or services that are uniquely enabled by AI; or they can improve 
their efficiency or profitability by using AI and/or robotics for automation.
* Professionals can learn the skills related to this new technology, and make themselves more employable.

To realise these opportunities, startups, businesses and professionals all need to wrap their heads around 
this new technology and upskill so that they have the knowledge needed to unlock those new opportunities.

The newness of the technology and the speed at which it is evolving means that there are very few experts. 
No-one has 5 years experience working with generative AI,, because it is only 24 months old.

In contrast to the opportunities, there is the real threat that existing SMB‚Äôs that fail to leverage this t
echnology will be out-competed by those that do. And we must not wave away the likely disruption that AI wi
ll have on white-collar professionals. Much of that is outside of our control but what we can do is try to
ensure that our region is as well-informed and prepared as it can be, so that it benefits from this technol
ogy shift and does not get left behind.

The Tokenizer program aims to lift awareness about the opportunities that AI brings, and to help participan
ts by inspiring them, upskilling them and supporting them.

The RDA support would allow us to include SMB‚Äôs in the program and would fund specific activities aimed at 
that cohort.

## **Approach**

The approach is to try to provide AI exposure and upskilling support to a significant number of medium size
 enterprises in the region so that they can take those learnings and immediately implement some of the best
 practices in their organisations.

For a subset of those organisations, we will provide 1:1 commercial mentoring, to dig into specific opportu
nities and use cases for their business. This involves a more consultative approach and will benefit from t
he expertise of a mentor with significant experience helping organisations unlock commercial value from the
ir IP.

Finally, a smaller group of participants will be supported through developing an AI proof of concept, that 
would aim to validate that the ideas that were surfaced through the mentoring process, can be executed and
would deliver the intended value.

|  | \~30 participants |
| :---: | :---- |
|  | \~12 participants shortlisted |
|  | \~5 PoC‚Äôs supported |
|  |  |
|  |  |

## **Recruitment of Participants**

The Hub will work closely with the Chamber of Commerce, Food and Agribusiness Network, Manufacturing Excell
ence Forum, Tourism Noosa, Council and the RDA itself, to identify the businesses in the region that would
best benefit from the program and generate prospects via EOI.

Partners will be provided collateral and messaging to share the program opportunity with those prospects, a
s well as do our own outreach and marketing to reach companies that would best benefit from Tokenizer.

At this point, we believe that the Upskill offering can provide a valuable starting point for many business
es in the region, and the more intensive 1:1 mentoring and PoC opportunities should be thoughtfully allocat
ed to businesses that would best benefit, and, commit to, bringing a PoC to life and validating its potenti
al.

## **Mentors**

This stream will be led by Steve Telburn, a highly experienced CEO, commercialisation mentor, advisor and v
enture partner.

Steve will draw on other mentors from the Tokenizer bench, on-demand, as the participants are qualified and
 selected, and their specific needs and opportunities are better understood.

Our view is that this stream of activities will generate the most value if it results in proof of concept e
xecutions that help the participating companies actualise the value that AI and automation can bring to the
ir businesses.

ting the funding to these activities

| Category | Description | Budget |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Marketing | Expenditure to find and recruit participants | 10% |

Tokenizer Program: Simplified Framework

Instead of getting lost in the weeds of individual activities, let's think in terms of core program pillars
. Based on your proposal and the RDA information, here's a simplified framework:

I. Core Pillars:

We can essentially distill the Tokenizer program into three core pillars:

1. Attract: Bring in new AI & Robotics startups and talent to the region.  
2. Nurture: Support the growth and development of existing startups and founders.  
3. Upskill: Develop the broader AI talent pool within the region (including existing businesses).

II. Mapping Activities to Pillars:

Now, let's map the proposed activities from your grant application to these pillars:

| Pillar | Activity | Simplified Description | Scalability |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Attract | Outbound marcomms, Prospectus, Storytelling, Concierge inbound EoI‚Äôs | Targeted Outreach & Mark
eting \- Promote Noosa as an AI hub | Moderate \- Requires targeted effort but can be amplified through dig
ital channels and partnerships. |
|  | Identify unknown, latent and potential AI & Robotics startups already in the region | Regional Talent 
Scouting \- Find existing players | High \- Leverage existing networks (Chamber, other orgs) and online pla
tforms to identify potential. |
| Nurture | Zero to one startup mentoring, AI founder network, Needs-based mentor matchmaking | Mentorship 
& Founder Support \- Provide guidance, resources, and connections | Moderate \- Relies on mentor availabili
ty but can be structured with group sessions and online resources. |
| Upskill | Build awareness of AI opportunity set & need for skills | AI Awareness Campaigns \- Broad outre
ach to educate about AI's potential | High \- Can leverage online platforms, webinars, and partnerships for
 broad reach. |
|  | Gather EOI‚Äôs | Interest Capture & Pipeline Building \- Collect data, identify skill gaps | High \- Aut
omated forms and online platforms can streamline this. |
|  | Offer Classes, Workshops, Hackathons | Skills Development Programs \- Hands-on training, workshops, an
d practical application | Moderate to High \- Scalable through online delivery, partnerships with training
providers, and train-the-trainer models. |
| Lab | a project to productise living lab facilities for Robotics activities, building on initial living l
ab prototype developed through Firetech Connect program | Robotics Living Lab \- Provide access to equipmen
t and facilities | Moderate \- Requires initial investment but can be scaled through memberships and usage
fees. |
|  | Prospectus, membership model, stakeholder support, delivery model | Develop Lab Resources & Framework 
\- Create materials, processes and partnerships | High \- Once developed, these can be reused and adapted f
or different projects. |

III. Simplifying for Scalability:

Now, let's abstract these further into scalable program components:

1. Ecosystem Development: This encompasses "Attract" and aspects of "Nurture" and "Upskill". Think of it as
 building the overall environment for AI to thrive.
   * Activities: Targeted outreach, marketing, community building, networking events, relationship building
 with other regional bodies, establishing partnerships.
   * Scalability: High \- leveraging digital channels, partnerships, and creating repeatable event formats.

2. Talent Pipeline: This focuses on the "Upskill" pillar, creating a skilled workforce.  
   * Activities: Workshops, courses, hackathons, cadetships, online training, mentorship programs.  
   * Scalability: High \- Can leverage online platforms, train-the-trainer models, and partnerships with ed
ucational institutions.
3. Startup Acceleration: This is the core of "Nurture", providing direct support to startups.  
   * Activities: Mentorship, founder network, workshops tailored to startup needs (fundraising, scaling, et
c.), connections to investors and partners.
   * Scalability: Moderate \- Requires curated matching and expert input, but can be structured with cohort
 models and online resources.
4. Living Lab Access: This is your "Lab" pillar, providing crucial physical and technical resources.  
   * Activities: Providing access to equipment, facilities, technical expertise, and testing environments. 

   * Scalability: Moderate \- Dependent on physical space and equipment, but can be scaled through membersh
ips, partnerships, and tiered access models.

IV. Key Actions for Scalable Delivery:

1. Develop Standardized Program Modules: Create core modules for workshops, courses, and mentorship program
s that can be adapted and reused.
2. Build a Strong Online Presence: Leverage a robust website, social media, and online platforms to deliver
 content, attract participants, and foster community engagement.
3. Train the Trainer: Develop a program to train mentors and instructors, expanding your capacity to delive
r programs.
4. Partnerships: Collaborate with other organizations (universities, industry groups, etc.) to leverage the
ir resources and expertise.
5. Data-Driven Approach: Track key metrics (participation rates, satisfaction, job creation, etc.) to measu
re impact, identify areas for improvement, and demonstrate value to stakeholders.
6. Phased Rollout: Start with core offerings and gradually expand based on demand and available resources. 
Prioritise based on the immediate needs of the ecosystem and demonstrated interest.

Now I can see what's happening. The script is working correctly in terms of:
1. Finding the knowledge base directory
2. Reading the manifests
3. Selecting relevant documents
4. Accessing the files

However, there seems to be an issue with the content selection. Looking at Steve Ringo's bio from the Bios.csv file:

```
Steven Ringo is a seasoned technology executive, currently serving as the Vice President of IT & Security at Epiminder, a leading biotechnology firm focused on developing innovative EEG recorders for epilepsy monitoring. With a strong foundation in electrical engineering and an MSc in Engineering Management from the University of the Witwatersrand, Steven brings over two decades of diverse experience in software architecture, cloud solutions, and AI-driven technologies. He has successfully led transformative projects at prestigious organizations, including Amazon Web Services, where he guided software businesses in modernizing their applications and adopting cloud solutions. Throughout his career, Steven has been instrumental in architecting scalable systems and implementing best practices in cloud computing, particularly within regulated environments like healthcare. As a mentor in the Tokenizer program, he will leverage his extensive expertise in AI and software development to empower startups and SMBs in the Sunshine Coast region, fostering innovation and driving economic growth. His commitment to upskilling local talent and enhancing technological capabilities aligns perfectly with the program's vision, making him a valuable asset to the Tokenizer initiative.
```

The issue is that the script is working as designed, but the content selection model might need some tuning. Let me make a few suggestions for improvement:

1. The LLM's selection of documents could be improved by:
   - Adding more context about the specific use case (writing a bio for a talk)
   - Adding weights or relevance scores to the selected content
   - Filtering out test documents and irrelevant content

2. The knowledge base creation could be improved by:
   - Better formatting of CSV content into markdown tables
   - Adding headers and sections to make the content more readable
   - Filtering out test entries and empty rows

Would you like me to modify the script to make these improvements? Or would you prefer to use the existing content to write the bio for Steve Ringo's upcoming talk on AI agents?
