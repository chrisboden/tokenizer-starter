## Testing CLI Tool for Structured Outputs (02/03/2025, 21:47:34)

_**User**_

i want this cli tool to use structured outputs format from the llm

start by testing the cli by passing in this message 'please create an engaging and detailed email digest with the things i have bookmarked over the last 2 weeks' 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the `tools_agent.py` to use structured outputs and then test it. First, let's modify the code to use structured outputs with the OpenRouter API.

I'll edit the file to add the response format schema:

---

_****_

```diff
  {manifest}
  
- Your response should be a valid JSON object which outlines the plan for which tools need to be called, with what arguments and in what order.
- 
- The JSON MUST follow this exact schema:
- {{
-   "plan": {{
-     "summary": "Brief summary of the overall plan",
-     "steps": [
-       {{
-         "tool": "tools/filename.py",
-         "command": "command_name",
-         "arguments": {{ "arg1": "value1", "arg2": "value2" }},
-         "purpose": "Explanation of why this step is necessary"
-       }}
-     ]
-   }}
- }}
- 
- IMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY valid JSON that can be parsed with json.loads() - no other text before or after.
- 
- For each step:
- 1. "tool" should be the pathed filename of the tool (e.g., "tools/use_twitter.py")
- 2. "command" should be the specific command to run (e.g., "likes")
- 3. "arguments" should be an object containing all required parameters for the command. In the case where the arguments for a subsequent step are the output of a previous step, you should note that the output of the previous step is the value for the argument.
- 4. "purpose" should explain why this step is necessary
- 
- Be specific and detailed in your plan. Include all necessary steps to complete the user's request.
- """
+ Your response must follow the exact schema provided in the response_format parameter."""

      try:

+                                             "purpose": {
+                                                 "type": "string",

+             }
          )
          
```

Now that I've updated the code to use structured outputs, let's test it with your example message. I'll run the command:

---

_****_

```bash
python3 agents/tools_agent.py "please create an engaging and detailed email digest with the things i have bookmarked over the last 2 weeks"
```

```
chrisboden@Chriss-MacBook-Pro tokenizer % python3 agents/tools_agent.py "please create an engaging and deta
iled email digest with the things i have bookmarked over the last 2 weeks"                     python3 agen
ts/tools_agent.py "please create an engaging and detailed email digest with the things i have bookmarked ov
er the last 2 weeks"
Error: No response received from LLM
chrisboden@Chriss-MacBook-Pro tokenizer %
```

It seems we encountered an error. Let's check if we have the required environment variables set up. I'll check the current directory structure to see if we have a `.env` file:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **14** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `notes` |
| 📁 `temp` |
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📁 `agents` |
| 📁 `tools` |
| 📄 `email_digest.md` |
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📁 `knowledge` |
| 📄 `.env` |
| 📁 `memory` |
| 📁 `.cursor` |
| 📁 `evals` |
| 📁 `instructions` |
| 📁 `.specstory` |

</details>

---

_****_



I see we have a `.env` file. Let's check if we have the required environment variables:

---

_****_

Read file: .env

---

_****_



I see that we have both `API_BASE_URL` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set in the `.env` file. Let's also check if we have the required `manifest.json` file:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory tools • **6** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `manifest.json` |
| 📄 `use_email.py` |
| 📄 `use_twitter.py` |
| 📄 `use_linkedin.py` |
| 📄 `manifest.py` |
| 📄 `use_knowledge.py` |

</details>

---

_****_



Great, we have the `manifest.json` file. Let's check its contents:

---

_****_

Read file: tools/manifest.json

---

_****_



I see that we have all the necessary files and configurations. The error might be related to the model's response. Let's try running the command again with a different model:

---

_****_

```diff
      try:
          response = client.chat.completions.create(
-             model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
+             model="google/gemini-pro",
              messages=[
                  {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
```

---

_****_





Now let's try running the command again:

---

_****_

Cancelled

---

_****_



---

_**User**_

try test the change again please

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll run the test command again with your example message:

---

_****_

```bash
python3 agents/tools_agent.py "please create an engaging and detailed email digest with the things i have bookmarked over the last 2 weeks"
```

```
chrisboden@Chriss-MacBook-Pro tokenizer % python3 agents/tools_agent.py "please create an engaging and deta

Error: Invalid JSON response from LLM: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
chrisboden@Chriss-MacBook-Pro tokenizer %
```

---

_****_



It seems we're getting a JSON parsing error. This suggests that the model we're using (google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001) might not be properly handling the structured output format. Let's try using an OpenAI model that we know supports structured outputs well. I'll modify the code to use "openai/gpt-4":

_****_

Cancelled

_**User**_

please add debug so we can see what the llm responds with and where our parsing is going wrong

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add debug logging to see the raw response from the LLM before we try to parse it:

              messages=[
                  {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
                  {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}

Now let's try running the command again with our debug output:

---

_**User**_

debug please

---

_**Assistant**_

I notice something interesting in the debug output. The LLM is returning what appears to be a valid JSON response, but it's wrapping it in markdown code block syntax (```json ... ```). This is why the JSON parser is failing - it's trying to parse the markdown formatting rather than the actual JSON content.

Let's modify the code to strip out any markdown formatting before parsing:

---

_****_

```diff
          print("\n")
              
+         # Clean the content by removing markdown code block formatting if present
+         if content.startswith("```"):
+             # Find the first and last ``` and extract content between them
+             start_idx = content.find("\n", content.find("```")) + 1
+             end_idx = content.rfind("```")
+             if end_idx > start_idx:
+                 content = content[start_idx:end_idx].strip()
+                 print("\nDEBUG: Cleaned JSON:")
+                 print("=" * 50)
+                 print(content)
+                 print("=" * 50)
+                 print("\n")
+             
          # Parse and validate the JSON response
          try:
```

Now let's test it again:

---

_****_

```bash
python3 agents/tools_agent.py "please create an engaging and detailed email digest with the things i have bookmarked over the last 2 weeks"
```

```
